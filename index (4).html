<p>Trained as a <span id="FullStack" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll">Full-Stack Developer</span> at <br>
  <span id="TechAcademy" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll" ><a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The
  Tech Academy Software Engineering Boot Camp</a></span>, <br> I gained valuable experience working with the following programming languages and
   software developement tools:<span id="Tools" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll" > C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET, Object-Oriented Program (OOP), MVC,
      Entity Framework, SQL, Databases, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and more.</span><br><br><br>
      </p>



<p>I have always enjoyed <span id="Apart" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll" >taking things apart to see how they work</span>,<span id="Fixing" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll" > fixing things that are broken</span>, and <span id="Figuring" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll">figuring out how to make things work better</span>. I like playing detective, gathering information, finding hidden clues, deciphering secret codes, and creating my own code to solve mysteries.
  <span id="Difficult"> I like the challenge of working through difficult situations where the circumstances that you have to work with are often less than perfect. Creating something where there seems to be nothing is an amazing experience. Finding a solution and then making it a reality...There are few things that feel better than that!</span> 
  I'd say that I am a good cheerleader. If someone needs help, I do what it takes to get the help we need. <span id="TakePride" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll">I take pride in my work.</span><br><br><span id="Better" class="in-line-word show-on-scroll">I smile and laugh alot. I like to give and receive compliments. I appreciate the talents and contributions of others.
    I do my best to be thoughtful and considerate. I have strong opinions but I am interested and open to hearing the viewpoints of others. I like to win. I also appreciate strong opposition, without which we cannot learn and grow. There is always more to learn and more than one way to get where you are going. So win or lose, make sure to make most out of every situation. I am a strong believer in the right to change your mind. It takes a strong and courageous person to admit when they are wrong. I am NOT a quitter. I am proud to say that God is my Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.
  <br> <br>So, yeah... I guess you could say, "That's ME!" </span>

        Here's To The Crazy Ones.<br>
        The misfits. The rebels. 
        The trouble-makers.<br> The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.<br>
     They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status-quo. <br>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them.<br>
        About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things.<br> They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
<br>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world
- are the ones who do!<br>
